# fortran-yaml-cpp

**NOTE: Use [fortran-yaml-c](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/fortran-yaml-c) instead. I am not longer maintaining this project.**

This is [YAML](http://yaml.org) parser for Fortran matching the [YAML 1.2 spec](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/).

This package uses the C++ package [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) to parse yaml documents, then stores the data in Fortran derived types created by [fortran-yaml](https://github.com/BoldingBruggeman/fortran-yaml). Hence the name `fortran-yaml-cpp`.
